            Homemade Sushi is so much cheaper than at the restaurant. Sushi is easy and fun to make at home, <br>
             and you can put all your favorite ingredients into your perfect custom roll — here’s how!

            <p>
                <strong>To get started, you need the right kind of seaweed. The one on the left below is thick and perfect for rolling sushi (this is the one I use). <br>
                 The one on the right is too flimsy. I use that seaweed for snacking.
                 Make sure you get seaweed specific for sushi-making, which it should <br> state on the package. 
                 Spread the seaweed with a layer of prepared sushi rice (this whole post covers how to make the rice), <br>
                  and flatten gently with a rice paddle (but do not smash the rice, as my mom would always say): <br>
                  For my sushi this time, I got this gorgeous piece of salmon. It was a 1/2lb piece, and gave us enough fish for about 6 rolls, plus some snacking.<br> Even at $28/lb, 
                   which seems like a lot, paying $14 for that much fish is certainly worth it, and dirt cheap if you ask me!

            <strong>Here is how I cut salmon for my sushi rolls. First, cut straight down through the filet, then cut that piece in half through the center so you have a small strip: <br>
                Place your desired ingredients onto the rice. I’ve got salmon, avocado, and cream cheese (I know, I know. But Philly-style rolls are my favorite): <br>
                Roll it up tightly, using a bamboo mat. It’s a specific kitchen item, but you can get a decent one for less than $2 on Amazon, so I think it’s worth having.
                <br> If you don’t have one, you can sort of use parchment paper or plastic wrap, but you won’t be able to wrap it as tightly, so buy one if you plan to make sushi regularly. <br>
                Then use a sharp knife to cut the sushi roll into pieces. I don’t find it particularly better to use a serrated knife. Just make sure to use a sharp one!
